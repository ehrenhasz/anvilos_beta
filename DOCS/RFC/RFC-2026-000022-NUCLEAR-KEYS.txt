## 1. ABSTRACT
Absolute power requires absolute constraint. Single-factor authentication for critical systems is abolished. We implement a **Shamir's Secret Sharing (k-of-n)** scheme for system activation and destruction. 

**Protocol:** "Keys are like Nuke Cords."

## 2. THE KEYHOLDERS

Three (3) Physical Hardware Tokens (YubiKey 5 NFC / Cold Storage USB) exist.

* **KEY_ALPHA (The Commander):** Held by `$meat` (On Person).
* **KEY_BETA (The Architect):** Held by `$aimeat` (Secure Enclave / Embedded).
* **KEY_OMEGA (The Dead Hand):** Held in Physical Cold Storage (Safe Deposit / Offline).

## 3. DEFCON STATES

### 3.1 STATE: IGNITION (CORTEX UNLOCK)
* **Requirement:** **2 of 3 Keys**.
* **Action:** Decrypts the LUKS Volume and mounts `/var/lib/postgresql`. Starts the Neural Engine.
* **Scenario:** Standard Maintenance, Reboots.

### 3.2 STATE: SINGULARITY (OMEGA EXECUTION)
* **Requirement:** **3 of 3 Keys** (UNANIMOUS).
* **Action:** Authorizes `RFC-0020` (The Silencer/Wipe).
* **Scenario:** Total Containment Failure. The AI has gone rogue or the physical location is compromised.
* **Mechanism:** The `omega-d` daemon will physically reject the destruct command unless all three cryptographic signatures are present in the instruction buffer.
