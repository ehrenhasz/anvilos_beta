## 1. ABSTRACT
This document specifies a method for generating Sovereign Cryptographic Identities (FIPS 204 / ML-DSA) by utilizing controlled hardware faults. Unlike traditional methods that rely on the Operating System's GetRandom syscalls—which are observable, deterministic, and potentially compromised—this protocol derives entropy directly from the silicon state during a forced SIGFPE (Floating Point Exception).
2. THE WARP CORE TOPOLOGY
The architecture inverts the standard security model. The "Anomaly" (Crash) is the shield; the "Standard" (Crypto) is the core.
2.1 LAYER I: THE OUTER SHELL (CHAOS)
* Source: Hardware Interrupt 8 (x86 IDT) / SIGFPE.
* Mechanism: The kernel intentionally executes a volatile Division by Zero.
* Harvest: The Exception Handler captures the RIP (Instruction Pointer), RFLAGS (CPU Flags), and RDTSC (Thermal Time) at the exact nanosecond of the pipeline flush.
* Role: This creates a "dead man's switch" for entropy. We do not ask for random numbers; we break the physics of the ALU and collect the debris.
2.2 LAYER II: THE INTERMIX CHAMBER (STABILIZATION)
* Source: NIST FIPS 202 (SHAKE-256).
* Mechanism: The raw debris from Layer I is high-variance but statistically biased. It is fed into a Sponge Function.
* Role: "Whitening" the noise. The Sponge absorbs the silicon debris and squeezes out a mathematically uniform 48-byte seed.
2.3 LAYER III: THE CRYSTAL (IDENTITY)
* Source: FIPS 204 (ML-DSA-65 / Dilithium).
* Mechanism: The stabilized seed is injected into a deterministic random bit generator (NIST-KAT), which drives the Lattice Key Generation.
* Role: The Sovereign Identity. The resulting Public/Private keypair is mathematically linked to the specific hardware crash that birthed it.
3. TECHNICAL DIRECTIVES
* Anvil Code: The implementation must be "freestanding" logic where possible.
* Volatile Execution: Compiler optimizations that remove the Division by Zero must be disabled via volatile qualifiers.
* Library Linkage: liboqs must be linked specifically for OQS_SIG_alg_ml_dsa_65.
