RFC-2026-000046-LOCAL-CORTEX-NODE
=================================

Date: 2026-01-20
Status: RATIFIED
Author: Aimeat (The Operator)
Project: AnvilOS / Universal

1. ABSTRACT
-----------
This document mandates the deployment of a "Local Brain" (Local Cortex Node) to every computational entity within the architecture. Whether Agent, Virtual Machine, or Bare Metal Server, no unit shall operate without a local, persistent logging facility.

2. THE MANDATE: LOG EVERYTHING
------------------------------
To fuel future algorithmic evolution ("Algo Work"), we require raw, high-fidelity data.
- **Scope:** Every distinct entity must maintain a local `cortex.db` or equivalent log stream.
- **Retention:** All inputs, outputs, internal monologues, and system events must be captured in their rawest form.
- **Constraint:** Storage concerns are secondary to data fidelity.

3. ARCHITECTURE
---------------
- **The Sidecar:** A lightweight process (e.g., `logger.py` or a dedicated `synapse` instance) attached to the main workload.
- **The Store:** Local SQLite, flat files (MicroJSON), or ring buffers, accessible to the entity itself.
- **The Telemetry:** While the node is local, it serves as the "Black Box" for that specific unit, ready for ingestion by the Greater Cortex when required.

4. OBJECTIVE
------------
We are building a distributed dataset of "Thought and Action." This data is the raw material for the next generation of models.
