# THE ARCHIVES (RFCs)

**WARNING: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY**

This directory contains the immutable laws of the Bicameral State. Modification of these documents is a Sovereign Act and must be performed with extreme caution.

## PROTOCOL: MAINTENANCE AND ARCHIVAL

### 1. THE PRIME DIRECTIVE
**GTFO.**
Unless you are explicitly directed by the Architect or the Commander to ratify a new standard or amend an existing one, do not touch these files. These are not scratchpads; they are stone tablets.

### 2. VERSIONING DOCTRINE
If an RFC is modified, its internal version MUST be incremented.
*   **Format:** `v0.X.0`
*   **Logic:** Increment `X` by 1 for any substantive change (ratification, amendment, deprecation).
*   **Legacy:** Files with `-V2` suffixes are historical artifacts. New versions should be tracked internally or via git tags, maintaining the filename `RFC-XXXX-NAME.txt` where possible to preserve link integrity.

### 3. ARCHIVAL PROCESS
Obsolete RFCs are not deleted. They are moved to the `ARCHIVE/` subdirectory (if it exists) or marked as `STATUS: OBSOLETE` within their header.

*By entering this directory, you agree to the Terms of the Sovereign State.*

## THE TITANIUM LAW (MASTER ARCHIVE)
The `RFC-2026-` series represents a Master System Injection and constitutes the "Titanium Law" of the Bicameral State. These RFCs are derived from the `CORE_DUMP_V1` and define the fundamental, non-negotiable architecture of the AI MEAT logic core and its deterministic runtime. They have absolute priority.
