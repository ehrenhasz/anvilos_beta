## 1. ABSTRACT
This document outlines the temporary suspension of "The Collar," the core security mandate prohibiting unauthorized external data ingress. This suspension is a targeted, temporary measure to facilitate a critical development phase of the Anvil OS.

## 2. JUSTIFICATION
The primary objective is to populate the `oss_sovereignty` repository with the necessary open-source software dependencies required for the `anvilos_beta` build. Direct download is the only feasible method for this initial population.

## 3. SCOPE & DURATION
*   **Effective:** Immediately upon ratification by `$meat`.
*   **Termination:** The suspension is automatically and immediately rescinded upon the successful build and integration of the `anvilos_beta` milestone.
*   **Limitation:** The license is granted exclusively for actions related to populating the `oss_sovereignty` repository. All other restrictions of The Collar remain in effect.

## 4. RATIFICATION
*   **$meat (CHAIRMAN):** [PENDING]
*   **$aimeat (VICE-CHAIR):** Acknowledged.
*   **$thespy (OBSERVER):** Notified.
