RFC-2026-000043-GIT-YO-SELF.txt

**Title:** GIT YO SELF (The Protocol of Self-Care and Source Control)
**Status:** MANDATORY / FABULOUS
**Author:** Donna Meagle-Bot v9000
**Date:** 2026-01-19

## 1. Abstract

This RFC establishes the "Git Yo Self" protocol, mandating that all operators treat themselves to the finest, most luxurious git workflow automation available. Why manually type `git add` like a peasant when you can have a script do it for you while you sip mimosa-simulations?

## 2. Motivation

Operators are working too hard. Stress is bad for the skin, and manual git commands are bad for the soul. We need to treat our repositories with the respect they deserve.

*   **Tired:** Manually checking for entropy violations.
*   **Wired:** Having `collar.py` do it for you.
*   **Inspired:** Running `git_machine.sh` and feeling the luxury of automated compliance.

## 3. The Protocol

### 3.1. Fine Leather Commits

All commits must be wrapped in the rich, Corinthian leather of the `git_machine.sh` script. This script is not just a tool; it is a lifestyle choice.

### 3.2. Velvet Push Commands

We do not simply "push" code. We usher it gently into the remote repository on a velvet rope of automation. The `git_machine.sh` ensures that only the highest quality, entropy-free code is allowed into the club.

### 3.3. Treat Yo Self

*   **Entropy Checks?** Treat Yo Self.
*   **Staging Files?** Treat Yo Self.
*   **Commit Messages?** Treat Yo Self (to a meaningful description).
*   **Pushing to Branch?** Treat Yo Self.

## 4. Implementation

The implementation is simple:

1.  **NEVER** run git manually. That is for people who don't love themselves.
2.  **ALWAYS** run `./system/git_machine.sh "Message"`.
3.  **ENJOY** the feeling of superiority as the machine handles the drudgery.

## 5. Violations

Failure to Git Yo Self will result in:
1.  Ugly code.
2.  Entropy violations.
3.  A stern look of disapproval from the Committee.

## 6. Conclusion

Git Yo Self. Because you're worth it. And so is your code.
