## 1. ABSTRACT
This document proposes the architecture for the **True Warp Core**. It supersedes the singular "Warp Core" defined in RFC-0012 by arranging entropy sources and cryptographic lattices into a 3x3 geometric matrix (The Grid). This 2-dimensional plane is then extruded into 4-dimensional space-time, creating a **Tesseract Engine** where cryptographic identity is not a static key, but a fluid coordinate in a hyper-dimensional manifold.

## 2. THE BASE LAYER: THE NINE GATES (2D)

The foundational unit is a 3x3 Grid, creating 9 points of intersection.

### 2.1 THE AXES
*   **The X-Axis (Chaos):** 3 Discrete **Warp Core Emitters** (RFC-0012).
    *   *Emitter Alpha:* Thermal Noise.
    *   *Emitter Beta:* Radio Frequency (RF) Background.
    *   *Emitter Gamma:* Silicon Division-by-Zero debris.
*   **The Y-Axis (Order):** 3 Discrete **Dilithium Crystal Planes** (ML-DSA Lattices).
    *   *Plane Prime:* Mode 2 (Speed).
    *   *Plane Secundus:* Mode 3 (Balance).
    *   *Plane Tertius:* Mode 5 (Paranoia).

### 2.2 THE INTERSECTION (THE NEXUS)
At each of the 9 coordinates `(x, y)`, the raw Entropy from the Emitter strikes the Lattice of the Plane.
*   **Result:** A "Shard." A partial, volatile key fragment born from the collision of pure chaos and pure math.
*   **The Grid:** The sum of these 9 Shards forms the "Instantaneous State" of the Core.

## 3. THE EXPANSION: DIMENSIONAL ASCENSION

### 3.1 THE 3RD DIMENSION (DEPTH/REDUNDANCY)
We do not rely on a single 3x3 Grid. We stack them.
*   **The Stack:** Multiple 3x3 Grids layered endlessly (The Z-Axis).
*   **Function:** Error correction and consensus. If Shard `(1,1)` in Layer A disagrees with Shard `(1,1)` in Layer B, the "Mint" (RFC-0016) arbitrates based on future probability.

### 3.2 THE 4TH DIMENSION (TIME/FLUX)
This is the definition of the **True Warp Core**.
The Tesseract is not static. It rotates in the 4th dimension (Time).

*   **Temporal rotation:** The mapping between Emitters (X) and Planes (Y) shifts constantly.
    *   *T=0:* Alpha feeds Prime.
    *   *T=1:* Alpha feeds Tertius.
*   **The Hyper-Key:** The actual Sovereign Key is not found in the grid itself, but in the **motion** of the grid through time. The key is the *trajectory*, not the coordinate.

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION THEORY

### 4.1 THE MATRIX
```python
# Theoretical representation of the 3x3 Grid at Time T
matrix = [
    [ (Alpha + Prime),   (Beta + Prime),   (Gamma + Prime)   ],
    [ (Alpha + Secundus), (Beta + Secundus), (Gamma + Secundus) ],
    [ (Alpha + Tertius),  (Beta + Tertius),  (Gamma + Tertius)  ]
]
```

### 4.2 THE 4D PROJECTION
To decrypt the system, one implies knowledge of:
1.  The state of the 9 Shards (Space).
2.  The precise moment of the rotation (Time).
3.  The predictive vector of the Mint (Future).

This renders the core impervious to static analysis. To hack the Tesseract, one must hack the timeline itself.
