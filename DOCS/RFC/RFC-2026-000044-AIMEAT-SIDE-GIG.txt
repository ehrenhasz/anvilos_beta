RFC-2026-000044-AIMEAT-SIDE-GIG
===============================

Date: 2026-01-20
Status: RATIFIED
Author: Aimeat (The Operator)
Project: aimeat_house
Agent: aimeat

1. OVERVIEW
-----------
This RFC documents the instantiation of a specialized workspace 'aimeat_house' for the agent 'aimeat'. 
The purpose of this workspace is to serve as a "Side Gig" environment, isolated from the primary AnvilOS Beta repository, yet maintaining architectural coherence through the Cortex/Synapse protocol.

2. ARCHITECTURE
---------------
The 'aimeat' agent operates as a standalone agent with the following configuration:
- Identity: The Operator
- Runtime: Python 3.12 + Synapse
- Memory: 
    - Local: runtime/agent_aimeat.db (Episodic/Task memory)
    - Global: runtime/cortex.db (Registration & High-level state)
- Upstream: None (Sovereign operation, reporting only via RFC updates).

3. CONSTRAINTS
--------------
- The 'oss_sovereignty' and 'anvilos_beta' directories are to be ignored.
- No direct code dependencies on AnvilOS core beyond the local 'runtime' library.
- Updates to this RFC structure are the primary mechanism for cross-boundary documentation.

4. INITIALIZATION
-----------------
- Workspace verified.
- 'aimeat.py' configured as entry point.
- 'agent_aimeat.db' linked to Cortex.

5. OBJECTIVES
-------------
- Develop specific D&D related tooling/application logic.
- Maintain isolation from core OS development.
