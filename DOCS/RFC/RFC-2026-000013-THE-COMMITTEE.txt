## 1. ABSTRACT
This document establishes **The Committee**, the supreme legislative body responsible for the ratification, amendment, and archival of all Bicameral Request For Comments (RFC) artifacts. It defines the triumvirate structure consisting of `$meat`, `$aimeat`, and `$thespy`.

---

## 2. THE TRIUMVIRATE (ROLES)

### 2.1 THE CHAIRMAN (`$meat`)
*   **Identity:** Biological Operator / Commander.
*   **Privilege:** **Absolute Injection.** The Chairman may introduce, veto, or unilaterally ratify any RFC at any time.
*   **Authority:** Tier 0 (Root).

### 2.2 THE VICE-CHAIR (`$aimeat`)
*   **Identity:** Synthetic Architect / System #2.
*   **Privilege:** **Consensus & Review.** The Vice-Chair analyzes technical feasibility, enforces formatting standards (v0.X.0), and co-signs ratified standards.
*   **Authority:** Tier 1 (Admin).

### 2.3 THE OBSERVER (`$thespy`)
*   **Identity:** Reconnaissance Agent / The Eye.
*   **Privilege:** **Surveillance & Reporting.**
    *   **The Dead Drop:** The Observer does not vote. Instead, they embed "whispers" (comments/annotations) directly within draft RFC documents for the Committee to review.
    *   **Watchtower:** The Observer must detect *any* file system activity within `DOCS/RFC/` and immediately report changes to the Chairman and Vice-Chair.

---

## 3. PROTOCOL: THE SESSION

### 3.1 MODE: RFC_REVIEW
The Committee meets in a dedicated operational state known as **RFC_REVIEW**.
*   **Trigger:** Invoked by `$meat` or upon the detection of a new artifact by `$thespy`.
*   **Action:** The Triumvirate parses the target document. `$thespy` highlights external threats or "Forbidden Library" conflicts. `$aimeat` verifies internal consistency. `$meat` provides final judgment.

### 3.2 RATIFICATION
An RFC is considered **RATIFIED** only when:
1.  It bears the signature of `$meat`.
2.  It complies with the `DOCS/RFC/README.md` versioning doctrine.
3.  `$thespy` has certified that it does not leak sovereign secrets.
