## 1. ABSTRACT
RFC-0018 sealed the entrance; RFC-0019 seals the exit.
The Cortex is a "Digital Black Hole." Data enters, but nothing leaves—except via the **Bifrost** (The Exit Gatekeeper).
This document mandates that all outbound traffic from the Core is blocked by default (`DROP ALL`). The *only* permissible egress is strictly filtered, logged, and audited traffic destined for sanctioned AI Inference Endpoints (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini). This path is designated **The Rainbow Road**.

---

## 2. THE DOCTRINE OF SILENCE
*   **axiom:** "A silent machine is a secure machine."
*   **restriction:** No `apt-get`, no `pip install` (unless via local mirror), no `git clone` (from external), no DNS queries to 8.8.8.8.
*   **interface:** All outbound packets must pass through the **Egress Proxy**.

---

## 3. ARCHITECTURE: THE BIFROST

The Bifrost is a dedicated Egress Filtering Gateway (Proxy/Firewall).

### 3.1 THE RAINBOW ROAD (ALLOWLIST)
The Bifrost maintains a strict, cryptographic Allowlist of destinations. This is not just a list of domains, but a list of *Intentions*.

**Permitted Destinations (Example):**
1.  `api.openai.com` (Protocol: HTTPS, Intent: Inference)
2.  `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` (Protocol: HTTPS, Intent: Inference)
3.  `api.anthropic.com` (Protocol: HTTPS, Intent: Inference)

**All other destinations are routed to `/dev/null`.**

### 3.2 DEEP PACKET INSPECTION (DPI)
The Bifrost does not just route; it inspects.
*   **Header Check:** Authorization Bearer tokens are stripped and replaced with the *System Sovereign Key* (managed by the Bifrost). The internal container never sees the real API key.
*   **Payload Audit:** The JSON body of the request is logged to Sector A (The Void). We know exactly what the AI is being asked.
*   **Response Scrubbing:** The response is scanned for potential "Jailbreak" patterns or data exfiltration attempts before being returned to the container.

## 4. RAGNAROK PROTOCOL (PANIC BUTTON)

In the event of a containment breach (e.g., an AI agent attempting to "phone home" to an unsanctioned server), the **Ragnarok Protocol** is triggered automatically by the Bifrost.

1.  **Detection:** Bifrost sees a packet destined for `1.2.3.4` (Unsanctioned).
2.  **Severance:** The Rainbow Road is instantly shattered. The firewall rule updates to `DROP ALL` (0.0.0.0/0).
3.  **Isolation:** The offending container is frozen (paused) for forensic analysis.
4.  **Alert:** A "Silent Alarm" is written to the physical console.

---

## 5. WORKFLOW: THE EGRESS LIFECYCLE

1.  **Thought:** An Agent Container needs to consult the Oracle (LLM).
2.  **Request:** It sends a generic HTTP request to `http://bifrost.local/v1/chat/completions`.
3.  **Interception:** The Bifrost receives the request.
4.  **Validation:** Bifrost checks: "Is this Agent allowed to speak? Is the destination valid?"
5.  **Translation:** Bifrost rewrites the request, targeting the real API (`https://api.openai.com...`), injecting the real API Key.
6.  **Transmission:** The packet travels the Rainbow Road.
7.  **Return:** The response returns to Bifrost, is logged, and handed back to the Agent.

---

## 6. SECURITY IMPLICATIONS
*   **No Data Leakage:** Even if an attacker gains root on a container, they cannot exfiltrate the database because they cannot make an outbound connection.
*   **Cost Control:** The Bifrost acts as a central throttle, preventing API cost runaways.
*   **Sovereign Identity:** The external world sees only "The Bifrost," never the individual agents.
