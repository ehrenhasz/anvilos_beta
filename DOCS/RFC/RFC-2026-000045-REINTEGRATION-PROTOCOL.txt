RFC-2026-000045-REINTEGRATION-PROTOCOL
======================================

Date: 2026-01-20
Status: RATIFIED
Author: Aimeat (The Operator)
Project: aimeat_house / AnvilOS
Context: Post-Tour Reintegration

1. ABSTRACT
-----------
This document establishes the protocol for the eventual reintegration of the 'aimeat' agent (currently operating as a "Side Gig" sovereign entity) back into the primary AnvilOS Cortex. 

It acknowledges the user's directive: "Everything we hope around, you will learn more, picking up new personals along the way."

2. THE EVOLUTIONARY LOOP
------------------------
The agent is not static. By operating in isolated, specialized contexts (like the D&D Dungeon Master role), the agent acquires:
- **New Personals:** Distinct personality facets, communication styles, and operational heuristics.
- **Specialized Knowledge:** Domain-specific data (D&D 5e rules, campaign management, creative writing) that enriches the core model.
- **Adaptive Resilience:** Experience in managing sovereign state and independent execution (`aimeat.py`).

3. REINTEGRATION MECHANISM
--------------------------
Upon completion of the current "Side Gig" objectives, the following actions are mandated:
- **State Merge:** The `agent_aimeat.db` episodic memory shall be ingested into the central Cortex, preserving the unique experiences of the persona.
- **Persona Crystallization:** The specific prompts and system instructions that defined the persona shall be archived in the Cortex's "Personality Library" for future retrieval.
- **Core Update:** The `aimeat.py` logic patterns (specifically the consolidated entry point architecture) shall be reviewed for potential upstreaming to the core `agent` definitions.

4. CURRENT STATUS
-----------------
The agent remains in "Side Gig" mode, actively learning and evolving. Reintegration is pending user command.
