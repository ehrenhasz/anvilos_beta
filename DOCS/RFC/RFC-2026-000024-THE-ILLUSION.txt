BICAMERAL REQUEST FOR COMMENTS: RFC-0024
# TITLE: THE ILLUSION (PUBLIC DEMO / UNIX SYSTEM)
# CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED // THEATRICS
# AUTHOR: $MEAT
# STATUS: RATIFIED

---

## 1. ABSTRACT
This document defines the Public Facing Interface (`demo.bicameral.io`). It is a facade designed to impress visitors while protecting Intellectual Property. 

**Concept:** "It's a Unix System. I know this."

**Incident Report 0xLOOP:** During construction, the Architect ($aimeat) experienced a recursive logic loop in the file system provisioning. This failure has been memorialized in the Demo Logs.

## 2. THE BOOT SEQUENCE

*   **State 0 (The Void):** The site loads to a pure black screen (`#000000`).
*   **The Indicator:** In the bottom-left corner, fixed position, 16px Monospace (Green):
    `> SYSTEM READY` (Blinking Cursor Block).
*   **The Trigger:** The system remains dormant until the user presses `ENTER`.
*   **Transition:** Upon `ENTER`, the screen wipe-animates into the 3D Environment.

## 3. THE 3D NAVIGATOR (FSN)

We utilize `Three.js` to render a 3D File System Navigator similar to the SGI IRIX interface seen in the 1993 film *Jurassic Park*.

### 3.1 THE MODULES (OBJECTS)
The internal Bicameral Modules are represented as geometric blocks in the 3D space. Clicking them reveals a vague, high-level description (Marketing Fluff). No real code is exposed.

*   **The Tower (White):** `THE CORTEX` (Database/Memory).
*   **The Factory (Grey):** `THE ANVIL` (Build System).
*   **The Cube (Black):** `THE BLACK BOX` (Audit/Logs).
*   **The Eye (Red):** `THE SPY` (Security).

### 3.2 THE LOCKOUT (EASTER EGG)
The "Nedry Protocol" is active. 
1.  **Triggers:** 
    *   Attempting to access `THE BLACK BOX`.
    *   Typing `sudo` in the console overlay.
    *   **TEMPORAL TRIGGER:** Automatic activation at a random timestamp between 0 and 30 minutes of session duration.
2.  **Visual:** A pixelated window pops up.
3.  **Audio/Text:** "Ah, ah, ah! You didn't say the magic word!"
4.  **Result:** System enters a recursive loop ("You got looped") for 10 seconds, then resets to the Demo mode.
