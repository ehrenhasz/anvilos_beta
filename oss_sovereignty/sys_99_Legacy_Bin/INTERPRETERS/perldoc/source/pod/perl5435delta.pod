perl5435delta - what is new for perl v5.43.5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.43.4 release and the 5.43.5
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.43.3, first read
L<perl5434delta>, which describes differences between 5.43.3 and 5.43.4.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Named Parameters in Signatures

This adds a major new ability to subroutine signatures, allowing callers
to pass parameters by name/value pairs rather than by position.

    sub f ($x, $y, :$alpha, :$beta = undef) { ... }

    f( 123, 456, alpha => 789 );

Originally specified in
L<PPC0024|https://github.com/Perl/PPCs/blob/main/ppcs/ppc0024-signature-named-parameters.md>.

This feature is currently considered B<experimental>, and is described in
further detail in L<perlsub/Signatures>.

S<C<use 5.42>> now turns on S<C<use source::encoding "ascii">> for the
remainder of the line (besides subsequent lines). [L<GH #23881|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/23881>]

=item *

Since 5.32.0, the second branch of a ternary condition operator wasn't
getting the correct autovivification context applied. For example in
something like

    @{ $cond ? $h{foo} : $h{bar} } = ...;

the first branch would correctly autovivify C<$h{foo}> to an array ref,
but the second branch might incorrectly autovivify C<$h{bar}> to a hash
ref. [L<GH #18669|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18669>].

=item *

Don't warn about jumping into a construct if we're DIE-ing [L<GH #23922|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/23922>]

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. There may also be information at
L<https://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
